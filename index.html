<aside>
<p>Of all the cities I've been to as a native Floridian, Miami, Gainesville,
Orlando and Tallahassee have left a lasting impression â€” especially on my taste
buds.</p>
<p>I have attached a photo of a dish or drink worth mentioning.
Feel free to hover over each city name to view another image.</p>
<p>During the assignment, I learned how to change images when a user hovers
over them through JavaScript. I also learned to double check to make sure you
don't have file extensions on your folder names. (This was especially
frustrating.)</p>
<p>All images are my own.</p>
